title: Marketers May Love Gmail's New Inbox

The more I talk to people about [Gmail's new inbox](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/new-gmail-inbox-gmail-changes_n_3353451.html), the more I hear reasons why marketers [should be freaking out](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/515716/marketers-must-hate-gmails-new-people-focused-inbox/) about their open rates. "No one will ever open the 'Notifications' or 'Promotions' tab," they say. "Everyone with an @gmail.com domain is basically dead to us now."

And it makes sense. All of users' marketing emails are essentially forwarded to a folder, and we all know what happens to an email when it gets forwarded to a folder (read: nothing).

#### A time and place for everything
* Members are reading all marketing emails in digest format

#### Send all you want
* Less likely to have churn from over-emailing
* People's tolerance for receiving marketing email is likely to go up, because it's no longer cluttering up their inboxes.

#### 10 of your less engaged user for 1 highly engaged user
* You're definitely losing some less interested members, but you could be gaining a whole new segment of members who click on your emails with more intentionality. Keep an eye on retention metrics after making the switch.
