Inspired by Paul Stamatiou's [epic post](http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll) on his switch to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I thought I'd write my own about my switch for this blog. My former blog, hosted on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/), gave me a lot of advantages not the least of which is the exposure one gets from being part of the broader Tumblr blog network.

But like many obsessive hacker-types, I wanted to try something new and feel like I'd built something catered to my precise needs. Having some experience in Rails development, I naturally scoured the web for some [Rails-based blogging engines](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1807670/blog-engine-for-rails-application) I could customize.

Of course, it didn't take long to realize that Rails wasn't the way to go. So when I heard about Jekyll, I was pumped. Bring it on!
