title: Why we need a Hyperloop
category: posts

Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind [Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) and [SpaceX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), has commented on the possibility of a high-speed transit system that could enable one to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than 30 minutes. He calls it the "Hyperloop," and it could be less expensive and more efficient than the currently planned high-speed rail line planned to connect SF and LA.

While Musk has yet to provide details on how the Hyperloop would be implemented, [several](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-elon-musks-hyperloop-2013-5) [theories](http://www.gizmag.com/how-does-elon-musk-hyperloop-work/27757/) have been put forward that make it reasonable to believe it could be done.
